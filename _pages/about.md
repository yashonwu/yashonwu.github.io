I am currently an AI Researcher at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) in Singapore. Prior to joining Huawei, I studied my PhD at the [Terrier Team](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/index.html) within the [Glasgow Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/#), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), supervised by Professor [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) and Professor [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/). My PhD research was mainly about **Multi-Modal Conversational Recommendation**. 
My PhD study was fully funded by the [Closed Loop Data Science Project](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/) ([EPSRC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R018634/1)) and the [Computing Science Excellence Bursary](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/schoolofcomputingscienceinternationalexcellenceawards/).

My recent research interest focuses on applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), including: 
- Truthful LLMs (w/ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG))
- LLM Powered Autonomous Agents
